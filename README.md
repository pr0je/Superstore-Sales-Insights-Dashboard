# Superstore-Sales-Insights-Dashboard
This repository contains a Tableau dashboard analyzing sales, profitability, and customer behavior using the Superstore dataset. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of business performance across product categories, shipping modes, customers, and geographic regions.
🚀 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to identify key business drivers and extract actionable insights related to:

Sales growth patterns

Customer retention trends

Profit margin by product segments

Geographic sales distribution

Shipping cost analysis

Pareto contribution of product categories

🧩 Key Dashboard Components
1. Avg Cost by Ship Mode

Compares average shipping cost across Same Day, Second Class, Standard Class, and First Class.

Highlights operational cost differences across shipment types.

2. Sub-Category Margin Analysis

Displays profit margin ratios for different sub-categories.

Reveals high-margin segments (e.g., Paper, Copiers, Accessories) vs. low/negative margin areas (e.g., Machines, Tables, Bookcases).

3. Customer Retention Analysis

Tracks retained customers year over year (2016–2019).

Shows improving customer loyalty and repeat sales behavior.

4. Sales by State (Geographical View)

U.S. map view representing sales intensity by state.

California, Texas, New York, and Washington emerge as top-performing regions.

5. Sub-Category Sales Distribution (Pareto Chart)

Visualizes sales contribution by sub-category.

Demonstrates that a small set of categories contribute major share to total revenue (Pareto principle 80/20).

📝 Insights Summary

Customer Base: Retention increases over time, supporting sustainable revenue.

Profitability: Not all high-sales categories are profitable; margin optimization is needed.

Operations: Same-day deliveries drive up transportation cost.

Geography: Sales are highly concentrated in a few regions.

Product Mix: Phones, Chairs, Storage, and Tables account for major revenue share.
