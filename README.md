- Sales distribution and product performance
- Customer retention trends over time
- Profit margins across product sub-categories
- Geographic revenue contribution by U.S. states
- Shipping mode cost impacts
- Pareto distribution of product categories

## 🧩 Dashboard Overview

The dashboard includes five major analytical components:

### **1. Avg Cost by Ship Mode**
- Compares average shipping costs across:
  - Same Day, Second Class, Standard Class, First Class
- Shows operational cost differences and shipping efficiency

### **2. Sub-Category Margin Analysis**
- Visualizes profit ratio by product sub-category
- Highlights high-margin vs low/negative margin segments
  - High Margin: Paper, Copiers, Accessories
  - Low Margin / Negative: Machines, Tables, Bookcases

### **3. Customer Retention Analysis**
- Tracks repeat customers from 2016–2019
- Shows growing retention trend and loyalty improvement

### **4. Sales by State (Geographical View)**
- U.S. map visualization for state-wise sales performance
- Top contributing states include:
  - California, Texas, New York, Washington

### **5. Sub-Category Sales Distribution (Pareto Analysis)**
- Displays sales by sub-category with cumulative % line
- Demonstrates 80/20 pattern where few categories drive majority of revenue

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Margin Imbalance:** Some strong sales sub-categories generate weak profit margins, indicating pricing or cost structure issues.
- **Positive Retention Trend:** Year-over-year increase in repeat customers supports sustainable revenue growth.
- **Shipping Cost Variance:** Same Day deliveries increase cost overhead significantly.
- **Geographic Concentration:** Revenue heavily concentrated on few U.S. states; potential room for regional expansion.
- **Pareto Pattern:** Phones, Chairs, Storage & Tables account for a major portion of total sales.
